This project is a Library Management System built using Python. It is designed to help libraries keep track of their books and members in an easy and organized way. The system allows a librarian to add new books, issue books to members, record returns, and check which books are available or borrowed. It also makes it simple to search for a book by its name, author, or ID. Instead of maintaining records on paper, this project provides a digital solution that saves time and reduces errors. It can be used in schools, colleges, or small public libraries to manage their day-to-day operations more efficiently.
